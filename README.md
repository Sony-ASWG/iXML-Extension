Sony PlayStation Studios' Audio Standards Working Group - iXML Extension

The ASWG iXML Extension is designed to provide developers of interactive audio content and audio researchers the ability to store production and research related metadata within the <BWFXML> chunk of a Broadcast Wave file, describing its contents and other related information.

The specification contains tags relating to metadata that can be used within interactive media development applications and workflows as well as machine learning and deep learning feature sets.

The extension contains labels covering sound effects, music, dialogue and audio-driven haptic content, as well as more general information.
