# iXML-Extension
Sony PlayStation Studios' Audio Standards Working Group - iXML Extension

The extension is designed to provide developers of interactive audio content and audio researchers the ability to store production and research related metadata within the BWFXML chunk of a Broadcast Wave file, describing its contents and other related information.
  
The specification defines fields relating to metadata that can be used within interactive media development applications and workflows as well as machine learning and deep learning feature sets.
  
The extension contains fields covering sound effects, music, dialogue and audio-driven haptic content, as well as more general project information.
  
Anyone may include the ASWG object and any of the tags contained in this document, if they find them useful. Please do not include any tags not listed in this document within the ASWG object.
  
The ASWG iXML Extension also contains a XSD Schema which can be used by developers to validate data.
